/*
BEGINNER DOCUMENTATION:

1. What is an array?
An array is a list of values. Example: ['HR', 'Finance', 'IT'].

2. What is an object?
An object stores related information using key-value pairs. Example: { name: 'Aisha', role: 'Requester' }.

3. What is export?
export allows other files to import and use these arrays and objects.

4. Why use mock data?
Mock data is fake data used while the backend is not ready. It helps us build and test the frontend design.

4.1 What are initialUsers?
initialUsers are dummy users shown on the Admin page so admins can test role and department management.

4.2 Why are documents objects now?
Each PDF needs more than a file name. The object stores the PDF URL, checklist page notes, and AI page suggestions for the frontend popup.

5. What are backend comments for?
In UI files, comments like BACKEND TODO explain where real API calls should be added later by the backend/frontend integration team.
